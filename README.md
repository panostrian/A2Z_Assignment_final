# LibraryBooks_A2Z_project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the final assignment I completed for the six-month e-Learning program, "Programming with Java: A to Z", offered by the Economic University of Athens (ΟΠΑ). The course was worth 10 ECTS points. I successfully passed with full grades and earned a certificate.

## About the Application

This project features a Java-based JDBC application that interfaces with a simple and small SQL database I created. The application is designed to manage book records within libraries.

### Database Setup

- **Location**: The database file is located at `LibraryBooks_A2Z_project/src/database`.
- **Usage**: To establish a connection, open the database file in MySQL.

## Features

- **Book Registration**: Register books into various libraries using a JDBC connection to manipulate and query the database.
