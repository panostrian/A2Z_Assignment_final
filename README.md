# LibraryBooks_A2Z_project

The final assignment I made for an e-Learning 6month programme, 
called "Programming with Java: A to Z", at the Economic University of Athens (ΟΠΑ) , worth 10 ECTS points,
and for which I succefully passed with full grade and gained a certificate.

It is a JDBC porgramme , which connects to a very simple and small SQL database I made (not included here). 
It registers books into libraries.
